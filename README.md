Design and implement a class. 

Use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses.

Correctly reason about control flow in a program using dynamic dispatch. 

Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype).

Use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members.

Define and use iterators and other operations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as arguments. 

Follow best practices for style and readability

Follow best practices for documentation
