# COP3003_IntegrationProject
This project is an final integration of skills learned throughout the semester for the Programming II course. It was also created independently by myself, Matthew Hawley, from October 2021 to December 2021. The level of experience and proficiency are not reflective of true individual skill as the .NET SDK was not supported, resulting in workflow run failures. The project successfully launched once then continued to fail afterwards.
